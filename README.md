# COSC455-Project2
The intention of this project is to provide continued experience in functional programming and compare the implementation Scala to that a pure functional language (Scheme) and that of imperative and logic programming languages. In doing so, you should develop a better understanding of functional programming and the concepts behind this class of programming languages.

This project will give you development experience in the following areas of programming languages that were covered in class:
* Functional programming
* Scala Scheme 
* List data structures
* Anonymous and higher-order functions

Further, the implementation of these concepts will give you further experience in essential programming concepts including:
* Problem solving
* Recursion
* Program design
